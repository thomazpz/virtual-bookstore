Virtual Bookstore
A Spring Boot-based application for building a virtual bookstore, including backend functionality for managing books, users, and orders. This project provides an API for a modern online bookstore, with potential for future frontend integration.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following programs installed:

Java 11 or higher (to run Spring Boot)
MySQL (for the database)
Postman (to test the APIs)
Step 1: Set Up the Database
Install MySQL
If you don't have MySQL installed yet, download and install it from the official website.

Create the Database
Open MySQL Workbench (or any other MySQL client) and create the database for the application:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE virtual_bookstore;
Configure the Database Credentials
In the project, open the application.properties file (or application.yml if using YAML) and configure the credentials to connect to your MySQL database:

properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/virtual_bookstore
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
Replace yourpassword with your MySQL user's password.

Step 2: Set Up Spring Boot
Install Maven/Gradle Dependencies
If you're using Maven, run the following command at the root of the project:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
If you're using Gradle, run:

bash
Copy code
gradle build
Run the Spring Boot Server
To start the application, run the following command:

For Maven:

bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
For Gradle:

bash
Copy code
gradle bootRun
Step 3: Test the APIs with Postman
API Endpoints Overview
To interact with different entities in the API, follow the general URL structure and change the entity name accordingly. Here is the format:

bash
Copy code
GET /api/{entity}             -> Retrieve a list of {entity}s
GET /api/{entity}/{id}         -> Retrieve a specific {entity} by ID
POST /api/{entity}             -> Create a new {entity}
DELETE /api/{entity}/{id}      -> Delete a specific {entity} by ID
Example with Entities
For Author:

GET /api/authors -> Get all authors
GET /api/authors/{id} -> Get a specific author by ID
POST /api/authors -> Create a new author
DELETE /api/authors/{id} -> Delete a specific author by ID
For Book:

GET /api/books -> Get all books
GET /api/books/{id} -> Get a specific book by ID
POST /api/books -> Create a new book
DELETE /api/books/{id} -> Delete a specific book by ID
For Order:

GET /api/orders -> Get all orders
GET /api/orders/{id} -> Get a specific order by ID
POST /api/orders -> Create a new order
DELETE /api/orders/{id} -> Delete a specific order by ID
For User:

GET /api/users -> Get all users
GET /api/users/{id} -> Get a specific user by ID
POST /api/users -> Create a new user
DELETE /api/users/{id} -> Delete a specific user by ID
Example Request Body
For POST requests, use the corresponding entity's structure for the request body. For instance, to create a new Author:

json
Copy code
{
  "name": "New Author",
  "biography": "Biography of the new author"
}
Similarly, adjust the request body for other entities (like Book, Order, and User) accordingly.
